# uigradients scss

Felt the need to have a collection of gradient variables from [uigradients.com](http://uigradients.com),
hence tweeked the parent repo [uiGradients](https://github.com/Ghosh/uiGradients).

### Special Thanks to [Indrashish Ghosh](https://github.com/Ghosh/) for his work on [uiGradients](https://github.com/Ghosh/uiGradients).

## Contents
1.  _gradients.scss Consist of all the gradient variables as shown below:

2.  _gradient-mixins.scss

Contains list of all gradient mixins(over time more shall be added)

## To Use
1. Simply paste the two files in your sass/ folder.
2. Since both are [partial files](http://sass-lang.com/guide),  just add 
```    ```

```ruby
@import 'gradient-mixin';
```
   on top of the style.scss file.
# Kindly Contribute Mixins for other gradient properties.
